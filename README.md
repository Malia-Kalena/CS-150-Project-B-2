### Thesis Statement
Urbanization and agricultural expansion are major contributors to deforestation. These changes in land use affect biodiversity and environmental sustainability. This project visualizes the relationship between urban expansion and deforestation across the world.

### Context
As urban populations grow and agricultural activities expand, natural forests are often cleared to make way for developing infrastructure and farming. This can lead to long-term environmental impacts like biodiversity loss and increased carbon emissions. This data visualization will draw attention to how different regions in the world balance land development and forest conservation.

### Data Visualization
The data visualization uses datasets from the World Bank Indicators to provide reliable and global data on urbanization and deforestation. Forest area indicates the proportion of land covered by forests. Agricultural land indicated how much land is converted for farming. Urban population growth indicates city expansion and how it affects land usage.

### Data Source
- Data set was provided from the World Bank Open Data
- Indicators: Forest area (% of land area), Agricultural land (% of land area), and urban population growth (annual %)

### Strategies from "Storytelling With Data"
- **Context:** Using explanatory analysis to communicate the impact of wildfires to Hawaii's air quality.
- **Choosing an Effective Visual:** Using line charts to focus on the trends of PM2.5 levels before, during, and after the wildfire.
- **Decluttering:** Keeping visualization simple to avoid unnecessary distractions.
- **Annotation:** Using annotation to explain nuances in data and highlight important info to pay attention to.
